## Select a Cover Option

<p align="center"><img class=" size-full wp-image-53 aligncenter" src="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/ArcGIS-StoryMaps/blob/master/screenshots/Image_5.jpeg?raw=true" alt="Capture" /></p>

7- The first step in creating a StoryMap is to create a cover.

8- Use the prompts on the screen to add a title and subtitle. 

9- Add your name to the by-line.

<p align="center"><img class=" size-full wp-image-53 aligncenter" src="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/ArcGIS-StoryMaps/blob/master/screenshots/Image_6.jpeg?raw=true" alt="Capture" /></p>

10- Click the "Add image" or "Add video" buttons to add multimedia content from your computer.

## Customize Your Design

<p align="center"><img class=" size-full wp-image-53 aligncenter" src="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/ArcGIS-StoryMaps/blob/master/screenshots/Image_6.jpeg?raw=true" alt="Capture" /></p>

11- Click the "Design" button in the top menu bar (on the right-hand side next to Preview and Publish).

<p align="center"><img class=" size-full wp-image-53 aligncenter" src="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/ArcGIS-StoryMaps/blob/master/screenshots/Image_30.jpeg?raw=true" alt="Capture" /></p>

12- The "Design" button opens up options for customizing your StoryMap's format, display, color, and font.

<p align="center"><img class=" size-full wp-image-53 aligncenter" src="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/ArcGIS-StoryMaps/blob/master/screenshots/Image_31.jpeg?raw=true" alt="Capture" /></p>

13- Explore the four different theme options to see what might be the best fit for your project.

<p align="center"><img class=" size-full wp-image-53 aligncenter" src="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/ArcGIS-StoryMaps/blob/master/screenshots/Image_35.jpeg?raw=true" alt="Capture" /></p>

14- In the Design panel, you can also customize the accent color and font pairings.

<blockquote>Learn more about using the Design Panel in Hannah Wilber's <a href="https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/products/arcgis-storymaps/sharing-collaboration/create-a-standout-story-with-arcgis-storymaps-design-panel/">"Create a standout story with ArcGIS StoryMaps' design panel"</a> blog post.</blockquote>

<p align="center"><img class=" size-full wp-image-53 aligncenter" src="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/ArcGIS-StoryMaps/blob/master/screenshots/Image_32.jpeg?raw=true" alt="Capture" /></p>

15- You can also change the cover layout. 

<p align="center"><img class=" size-full wp-image-53 aligncenter" src="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/ArcGIS-StoryMaps/blob/master/screenshots/Image_33.jpeg?raw=true" alt="Capture" /></p>

16- Choose between the full, side-by-side, and minimal options for the cover media.

<p align="center"><img class=" size-full wp-image-53 aligncenter" src="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/ArcGIS-StoryMaps/blob/master/screenshots/Image_34.jpeg?raw=true" alt="Capture" /></p>

17- Click on the gear icon (located in the top center of the image) to adjust the image properties.

18- Within Image Properties, you can change the focal point for the image, which is useful when working with images that are larger than the StoryMaps display window.

19- You can also add alternative text within Image Properties. Alternate text describes your media content for users with visual impairments who use a screen reader or other kinds of adaptive/assistive technologies.

<blockquote>Alternate text for media options is essential to make sure your content is available to the widest range of users. Learn more about alt text at <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/">the Web Accessibility Initiative</a>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Check out the tutorial video <a href="https://youtu.be/bJ40v5lxy0A">"Adding Alternative Text in ArcGIS StoryMaps"</a> from ArcGIS to learn more about alt text and accessibility in ArcGIS StoryMaps.</blockquote>

# Adding Content to Your StoryMap

20- Click on the plus sign below the cover section to open up a menu of options for building in StoryMaps.

<p align="center"><img class=" size-full wp-image-53 aligncenter" src="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/ArcGIS-StoryMaps/blob/master/screenshots/Capture_1.png?raw=true" alt="Capture" /></p>

21- StoryMaps uses a block palette to combine media, text, and other kinds of interactive content.

## Text Options

<p align="center"><img class=" size-full wp-image-53 aligncenter" src="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/ArcGIS-StoryMaps/blob/master/screenshots/Image_7.jpeg?raw=true" alt="Capture" /></p>

23- When editing text in one of the text block options, you can add formatting (bold, italics), insert a link to another URL, or switch to another type of text block from the palette.

### Paragraph

A block of text with no additional formatting.

### Heading

A section heading or title. Text is bolded and in a larger font size than Paragraph.

### Subheading

A section sub-heading or sub-title. Text is bolded. Font size is larger than Paragraph and smaller than Heading.

### Bulleted List

An unordered list of content that uses bullet points.

### Numbered List

An ordered list of content that uses numerals.

### Quote

Similar to the `<blockquote>` tag in HTML. Indents and italicizes text.

## Media Options

<p align="center"><img class=" size-full wp-image-53 aligncenter" src="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/ArcGIS-StoryMaps/blob/master/screenshots/Image_8.jpeg?raw=true" alt="Capture" /></p>

When adding media content, these blocks give you additional formatting options. 

The gear symbol allows you to customize the image focal point and add alt text.

<blockquote>Check out the tutorial video <a href="https://youtu.be/bJ40v5lxy0A">"Adding Alternative Text in ArcGIS StoryMaps"</a> from ArcGIS to learn more about alt text and accessibility in ArcGIS StoryMaps.</blockquote>

The four alignment options allow you to customize how the image is displayed in your StoryMap.

The trash can icon deletes your existing image and allows you to select new content.

When you add media content, the block automatically includes a place for a caption. Captions are optional--the "Add a caption" placeholder text won't be shown in the public story.

### Image

Upload an image from your computer or link to an image that exists online.

### Map

Bring in a map you have already created in ArcGIS Online, or create an Express Map from within the StoryMaps builder. More details on maps are provided in the [Additional Options for Customizing Maps](#additional-options-for-customizing-maps) section of this tutorial.

### Video

Upload a video from your computer or link to an online video. More details on maps is provided in a later section of this tutorial.

### Embed

<p align="center"><img class=" size-full wp-image-53 aligncenter" src="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/ArcGIS-StoryMaps/blob/master/screenshots/Image_27.jpeg?raw=true" alt="Capture" /></p>

## Formatting Options

### Button

A rectangular button icon that can link to external content.

### Separator

A solid line separator that can help mark transitions or shifts in your StoryMap.

### Sidecar

<p align="center"><img class=" size-full wp-image-53 aligncenter" src="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/ArcGIS-StoryMaps/blob/master/screenshots/Image_19.jpeg?raw=true" alt="Capture" /></p>

<p align="center"><img class=" size-full wp-image-53 aligncenter" src="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/ArcGIS-StoryMaps/blob/master/screenshots/Image_23.jpeg?raw=true" alt="Capture" /></p>

A split-screen layout within your StoryMap that inclues a panel with text that scrolls and a panel with media that remains stationary. 

<p align="center"><img class=" size-full wp-image-53 aligncenter" src="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/ArcGIS-StoryMaps/blob/master/screenshots/Image_21.jpeg?raw=true" alt="Capture" /></p>

# Reordering or Reorganizing Content

25- As you start to create blocks, you may want to reorganize or reorder your content.

<p align="center"><img class=" size-full wp-image-53 aligncenter" src="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/ArcGIS-StoryMaps/blob/master/screenshots/Image_9.jpeg?raw=true" alt="Capture" /></p>

<p align="center"><img class=" size-full wp-image-53 aligncenter" src="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/ArcGIS-StoryMaps/blob/master/screenshots/Image_10.jpeg?raw=true" alt="Capture" /></p>

26- The grid icon on the left-hand side of each block gives you the option to drag and drop blocks to re-order your content.

# Additional Options for Customizing Maps

## Existing ArcGIS Online Maps

<p align="center"><img class=" size-full wp-image-53 aligncenter" src="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/ArcGIS-StoryMaps/blob/master/screenshots/Image_11.jpeg?raw=true" alt="Capture" /></p>

27- Selecting the Map block opens up the Add a map window.

28- You can select a web map you have already created in ArcGIS Online. 

29- You can also select maps others have created and shared with your organization or the public ArcGIS Online user community. 

## Express Maps

As [described by Allen Carroll](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/cea22a609a1d4cccb8d54c650b595bc4), Express Maps allow you to "easily make simple maps that might show a single location, a series of locations (with pop-ups), and also routes and areas. You can add labels and arrows to maps."

<p align="center"><img class=" size-full wp-image-53 aligncenter" src="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/ArcGIS-StoryMaps/blob/master/screenshots/Image_11.jpeg?raw=true" alt="Capture" /></p>

In the "Add a map window", select the option to "Create an express map."

<p align="center"><img class=" size-full wp-image-53 aligncenter" src="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/ArcGIS-StoryMaps/blob/master/screenshots/Image_13.jpeg?raw=true" alt="Capture" /></p>

You can zoom or pan to show a specific area on the map. 

<p align="center"><img class=" size-full wp-image-53 aligncenter" src="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/ArcGIS-StoryMaps/blob/master/screenshots/Image_14.jpeg?raw=true" alt="Capture" /></p>

You can also use the drawing tools to add points to your map, draw lines, add text, or insert arrows.

<p align="center"><img class=" size-full wp-image-53 aligncenter" src="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/ArcGIS-StoryMaps/blob/master/screenshots/Image_16.jpeg?raw=true" alt="Capture" /></p>

You can also add an image, title, and description to your map points.
